# YT-Downloader-Server
Node.js express-based server which allows you to download videos from YouTube (mp3 or mp4)  

To run this locally you should download this repository, then build it with `tsc` and start with `node .`
You can try this out [here](https://spyte-yt-downloader.glitch.me)

## Configuration
In `config.json`, you can specify things like: maximum video length and after what time (in ms) to delete previously downloaded file  
In both cases if you type 0, it will disable these features

I made this because sites available on-line are full of ads
